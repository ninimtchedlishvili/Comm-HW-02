    <h2>James Webb Telescope goes 'extreme' and spots baby stars at the edge of the Milky Way (image)</h2>

    <p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has been no stranger to taking things to the extreme since its launch on Christmas day 2021, observing early galaxies billions of light-years away that existed when the universe was at a fraction of its currently 13.8 billion-year life.<br>Now, the powerful space telescope has pushed it to the edge closer to home in our very own galaxy, the Milky Way. A team of astronomers has pointed the JWST at the outskirts of the Milky Way, observing a region scientists call the "Extreme Outer Galaxy."<br>This area is about 58,000 light-years from the heart of the Milky Way, or "Galactic Center." For comparison, the solar system is located just under halfway between the Galactic Center and the very edge of the Milky Way. That distance is just 26,000 light-years, so when we say "extreme edge" for these new observations, that's more than hyperbole! The result of this galactic envelope-pushing exercise is a stunning image of star clusters in the midst of a "starburst" and an intense period of rapid star birth.</p>
