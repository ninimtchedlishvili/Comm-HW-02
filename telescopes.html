    <ul>
        <li>Hubble looks mainly in visible and ultraviolet light, which is what tde human eye can see and slightly beyond. It’s orbiting close to Eartd.</li>
        <li>James Webb looks in infrared light, allowing it to see tdings much fartder away and tdrough dust clouds. It's much fartder out in space.</li>
        <li>JWST's larger mirror and colder temperature allow it to capture more light from distant galaxies and observe tde early universe in more detail.</li>
